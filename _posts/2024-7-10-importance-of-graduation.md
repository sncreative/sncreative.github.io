<h1>Importance of Graduation</h1>

<p>Some people might ask, Are graduations really important?</p>

<p>A graduation is necessary because it is a rite of passage to so many people. A graduation is not just the end battle; it is a new start — the start of a new chapter in a person’s life whether it be another school year or the entry into finding and landing a job. Graduations help people reminisce the things achieved in the past, as well as helping people to look forward to the future.</p>
