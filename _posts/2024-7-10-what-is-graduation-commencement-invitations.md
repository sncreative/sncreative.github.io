<h1>What is graduation commencement invitations?</h1>

<p>Graduation commencement invitations are formal notifications sent out to invite guests to attend a graduation ceremony. These invitations typically include key details like the name of the student who is graduating, the name of the school, college, or university from where the student is passing out, the date and time of the commencement ceremony, the location where the ceremony will take place and any other relevant details such as dress code, directions, parking information, and post-ceremony celebrations. These invitations can be printed or digital and are often designed to reflect the significance of the occasion. They serve both a practical purpose in informing guests and a commemorative purpose as keepsakes for the graduate and their family.</p>
