<h1>What is a grad announcements?</h1>

<p>Graduation announcements are formal notifications sent to friends, family, and acquaintances to share the news of a person's graduation from high school, college, or another educational institution. These announcements serve several purposes like informing recipients where the graduate person and his/her family let the recipients know that the sender has achieved a significant milestone in their education, inviting to celebrations where they often include invitations to graduation ceremonies, parties, or other related events. Graduation announcements can also serve as a keepsake for both the graduate and the recipients, commemorating the achievement.</p>
