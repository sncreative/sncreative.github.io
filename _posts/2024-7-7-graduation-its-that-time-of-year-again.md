<h1>Graduation: It's that time of year again!</h1>    

<p>Graduation is a time of celebration. A time of a just reward. For some of us, midterms are almost over and for others, they're just the beginning but whatever the case maybe, spring break is just around the corner!!!</p>

<p>I bet a couple of you guys reading this will also be preparing for the time of graduation. You've toiled and labored for many years and now it is your time. Your day is coming and you will be getting your reward. You got your graduation cap and gown. You might even have a graduation ring. Now you just have to go through the graduation commencement ceremony and you're done. Isn't that just exciting?</p>
