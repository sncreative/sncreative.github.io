<h1>What to wear to graduation?</h1>    

<p>Do you know the graduation etiquette that you're supposed to have? What are the rules? First check with your school or college for specific rules (a lot of them have them).</p>

<p>What to wear to graduation?</p>

<p><strong>Dos:</strong></p>

<p><strong>For Girls:</strong><br/>
- Wear light, airy fabrics like cotton and linen. <br/>
- Wear something easy and elegant-- a simple dress or a skirt and blouse would be perfect. <br/>
- Wear a light color if your gown is white or yellow. It'll be cooler and the outline won't show up in pictures. <br/>
- Should go with a moderately dressy shoe (either flats or pumps are fine but, please, nothing that would look at home in a mosh pit).</p>

<p><strong>For boys:</strong><br/>
- May need to wear a tie depending on school customs. So, beg, steal or borrow a rep tie or foulard from someone to wear with a neatly pressed shirt in white, blue or any other pale color.<br/>
- Either a spread collar or button down, both are perfectly fine. Even if a tie is not required, it'll look so much better.<br/>
- Wear neatly pressed casual khaki or olive drab trousers. (Dress trousers are not a necessity.)<br/>
- Boys need to wear either a loafer or dress shoe.</p>

<p><strong>Don'ts:</strong><br/>
- Wear jeans and shorts. <br/>
- At any time do not wear flip-flops, sandals, tennis shoes or bunny slippers, regardless of the gender of the graduate.<br/>
- Do not affix a message out of masking tape letters to the top of her mortarboard or the back of the gowns!</p>
