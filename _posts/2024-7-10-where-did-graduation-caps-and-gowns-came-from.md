<h1>Where did graduation caps and gowns come from?</h1>

<p>In the 12th century, wearing of academic robes is a tradition, it was around the time when the first universities were being founded in Europe. During this time, most scholars were also clerics or aspiring clerics, and excess in clothing was not supported. As such, in the beginning it is thought that there was little difference between what the academics were wearing and the laymen, excepting that the academics and clergy tended to wear very plainly colored apparel.</p>

<p>Eventually, the apparel was simply basic. When the universities were originally formed, they had no official buildings of their own to hold lectures in, so classes were typically gathered in nearby churches. Their simple robes and outer covering served the purpose of keeping them warm in the airy medieval church buildings, and the hoods kept the weather off when they moved out of doors.</p>
