<h1>Graduation Speech</h1>

<p>Graduation is not complete without a graduation or commencement speech. It's a speech given by either a student, guest speaker or an alumnus of the university to the graduating class and their guests. Basically it is to wish the graduates well in the world outside academics, and to caution that they were taught to think in school or college. </p>
