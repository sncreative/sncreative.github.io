<h1>Graduation Speech</h1>

<p>Graduation is not complete without a graduation or commencement speech. It's a speech given by either a student, guest speaker or an alumnus of the university to the graduating class and their guests. Basically it is to wish the graduates well in the world outside academics, and to caution that they were taught to think in school or college. </p>

<p>For graduation, are you the one delivering the speech? If so here's a couple of quotes that you can use in your graduation speech. Check it out.</p>

<p>Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off your goal. ~Henry Ford</p>

<p>Sooner or later we all discover that the important moments in life are not the advertised ones, not the birthdays, the graduations, the weddings, not the great goals achieved. The real milestones are less prepossessing. They come to the door of memory unannounced, stray dogs that amble in, sniff around a bit and simply never leave. Our lives are measured by these. ~Susan B. Anthony</p>

<p>Keep in mind that neither success nor failure is ever final. ~Roger Babson</p>

<p>If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door. ~Milton Berle</p>

<p>Success isn't a result of spontaneous combustion. You must set yourself on fire. ~Arnold H. Glasow</p>

<p>A wise man will make more opportunities than he finds. ~Francis Bacon, Essays, 1625</p>

<p>Education is the best provision for old age. ~Aristotle</p>

<p>Don't waste time learning the "tricks of the trade." Instead, learn the trade. ~Attributed to both James Charlton and H. Jackson Brown, Jr.</p>

<p>There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. ~Beverly Sills</p>

<p>Don't be afraid to take a big step if one is indicated; you can't cross a chasm in two small jumps. ~David Lloyd George</p>

<p>What we are is God's gift to us. What we become is our gift to God. ~Eleanor Powell</p>

<p>Whenever it is possible, a boy should choose some occupation which he should do even if he did not need the money. ~William Lyon Phelps</p>

<p>My father always told me, "Find a job you love and you'll never have to work a day in your life." ~Jim Fox</p>

<p>During my second year of nursing school our professor gave us a quiz. I breezed through the questions until I read the last one: "What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?" Surely this was a joke. I had seen the cleaning woman several times, but how would I know her name? I handed in my paper, leaving the last question blank. Before the class ended, one student asked if the last question would count toward our grade. "Absolutely," the professor said. "In your careers, you will meet many people. All are significant. They deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say hello." I've never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her name was Dorothy. ~Joann C. Jones</p>

<p>You can't live a perfect day without doing something for someone who will never be able to repay you. ~John Wooden</p>

<p>The true meaning of life is to plant trees, under whose shade you do not expect to sit. ~Nelson Henderson</p>
