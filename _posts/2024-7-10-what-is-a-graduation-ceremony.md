<p>A graduation ceremony, also known as commencement, convocation, or graduation exercises, is a formal event that marks the completion of an academic degree or educational program. Graduation ceremonies are significant milestones for students and their families, symbolizing academic achievement, personal growth, and the transition to the next phase of their lives, whether that be further education or entering the workforce. A graduation ceremony is such a special occasion when friends and family can gather to celebrate hard-earned achievements.</p>
