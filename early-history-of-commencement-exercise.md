<h2>Early history of commencement exercise</h2>

Commencement exercises, commonly known as graduation ceremonies, have a rich and ancient history rooted in the traditions of medieval European universities. These ceremonies mark the completion of a student's course of study and the conferral of degrees. Here's a brief overview of the early history of commencement exercises:

<h3>Medieval Origins</h3>

1. <strong>European Universities</strong>: The origins of commencement exercises date back to the 12th and 13th centuries, with the establishment of the first universities in Europe, such as the University of Bologna (founded in 1088), the University of Paris (circa 1150), and the University of Oxford (circa 1096).

2. <strong>Scholastic Tradition</strong>: During the medieval period, universities were closely associated with the Church, and their ceremonies reflected religious rituals. The conferral of degrees was a formal academic exercise that involved rigorous examinations and public disputations (debates) on scholarly topics.

3. <strong>The Ceremony/<strong>: The term "commencement" signifies the beginning of a new phase in the graduate's life. The ceremonies often included:
   - <strong>Latin Orations</strong>: Academic exercises and speeches were conducted in Latin, the lingua franca of educated Europeans.
   - <strong>Academic Regalia</strong>: Graduates and faculty wore academic robes, a tradition that continues to this day. The design and colors of the robes signified the degree earned and the university attended.
   - <strong>Conferral of Degrees</strong>: Degrees were conferred by the chancellor or a high-ranking academic official, who would present a diploma and sometimes place a hood over the graduate's shoulders as a symbol of their new status.

<h3>Evolution and Spread</h3>

1. <strong>Renaissance and Reformation</strong>: As universities spread across Europe and evolved during the Renaissance and Reformation periods, the nature of commencement exercises also evolved. They became more elaborate, often including musical performances, feasts, and celebrations.

2. <strong>Colonial America</strong>: The tradition of commencement exercises was carried to the American colonies by settlers who established colleges such as Harvard (founded in 1636). The first commencement at Harvard took place in 1642 and followed the European model, including Latin speeches and formal academic regalia.

<h3>Modern Developments</h3>

1. <strong>19th Century</strong>: By the 19th century, commencement exercises had become significant public events in both Europe and America. They were attended by prominent members of society, including government officials, clergy, and community leaders.

2. <strong>20th Century</strong>: In the 20th century, commencement exercises became more inclusive and diverse, reflecting changes in higher education. Ceremonies began to incorporate speeches from distinguished guests, the singing of anthems, and the presentation of various awards and honors.

3. <strong>Contemporary Ceremonies</strong>: Today, commencement exercises are characterized by a blend of tradition and modernity. While academic regalia, formal speeches, and the conferral of degrees remain central elements, contemporary ceremonies often include multimedia presentations, student performances, and the involvement of family and friends in the celebrations.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

The history of commencement exercises is a testament to the enduring value of academic achievement and the importance of education in society. From their medieval origins to their modern manifestations, these ceremonies have evolved to celebrate the accomplishments of graduates and to mark the beginning of their professional and personal journeys.
