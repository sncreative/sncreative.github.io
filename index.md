<h3>What is a commencement exercise?</h3>
<p>Since we are talking about Graduation Invitations, let’s delve on this closing of a new chapter and why it is an important mark of huge success of every student’s life. There are numerous types of graduations—elementary graduation, high school graduation, college graduation, and so on.</p>
<p>Graduation—or also called commencement, convocation, or invocation—is the obtaining of a diploma or academic degree in which students become graduates. Before the graduation, candidates are referred to as graduands, and the date of graduation is often called graduation day. At the college and university levels, the faculty will usually wear academic dresses at the formal ceremonies, as will the administrator and degree candidates.</p>
<p>Graduation at the college and university level happens when the supervising officer deliberates degrees upon candidates, either individually or all at once, even if graduates physically receive their diploma later at a smaller college or departmental ceremony. After degree completion, graduates can be referred to by their graduating year.</p>

<h3>Early history of commencement exercise</h3>
<p>It was in the 12th century that graduation ceremonies for students date from the first universities in Europe. At that time, Latin was the language of scholarship. A universitas  was a guild of masters (MAs) with a licence to teach. Degree  and  graduate  come from  gradus , meaning “step.”</p>
<p>The first step was admission to a bachelor’s degree. The second step was the master’s step, giving the graduate admission to the universitas and license to teach. The typical dress for graduation are gowns and hoods or hats adapted from the daily dress of university staff in the Middle Ages, which was in turn based on the attire worn by medieval clergy.</p>

<h3>Where did graduation caps and gowns come from?</h3>
<p>In the 12th century, wearing of academic robes is a tradition, it was around the time when the first universities were being founded in Europe. During this time, most scholars were also clerics or aspiring clerics, and excess in clothing was not supported. As such, in the beginning it is thought that there was little difference between what the academics were wearing and the laymen, excepting that the academics and clergy tended to wear very plainly colored apparel.</p>
<p>Eventually, the apparel was simply basic. When the universities were originally formed, they had no official buildings of their own to hold lectures in, so classes were typically gathered in nearby churches. Their simple robes and outer covering served the purpose of keeping them warm in the airy medieval church buildings, and the hoods kept the weather off when they moved out of doors.</p>

<h3>Importance of Graduation</h3>
<p>Some people might ask, Are graduations really important?</p>
<p>A graduation is necessary because it is a rite of passage to so many people. A graduation is not just the end battle; it is a new start—the start of a new chapter in a person’s life whether it be another school year or the entry into finding and landing a job. Graduations help people reminisce the things achieved in the past, as well as helping people to look forward to the future.</p>
