<h2>What is a commencement exercise?</h2>

<p>Since we are talking about Graduation Invitations, let’s delve on this closing of a new chapter and why it is an important mark of huge success of every student’s life. There are numerous types of graduations—elementary graduation, high school graduation, college graduation, and so on.</p>

<p>Graduation—or also called commencement, convocation, or invocation—is the obtaining of a diploma or academic degree in which students become graduates. Before the graduation, candidates are referred to as graduands, and the date of graduation is often called graduation day. At the college and university levels, the faculty will usually wear academic dresses at the formal ceremonies, as will the administrator and degree candidates.</p>

<p>Graduation at the college and university level happens when the supervising officer deliberates degrees upon candidates, either individually or all at once, even if graduates physically receive their diploma later at a smaller college or departmental ceremony. After degree completion, graduates can be referred to by their graduating year.</p>

<p>A commencement exercise, commonly referred to as a commencement or graduation ceremony, is an event that marks the completion of an academic degree or program of study. It is a formal occasion typically held by educational institutions such as high schools, colleges, and universities.</p>

<p>Commencement exercises are significant milestones in the lives of students, symbolizing their hard work, achievements, and the transition to the next phase of their personal and professional lives.</p>

<p>Here's an overview of what a commencement exercise typically includes:</p>

<p>Processional: The ceremony usually begins with a processional, where graduates, faculty, and sometimes honored guests walk in a formal parade to their seats. This is often accompanied by music, such as "Pomp and Circumstance."</p>

<p>Welcome Address: The event often starts with a welcome address from a school official, such as the principal, dean, or university president, who greets attendees and sets the tone for the ceremony.</p>

<p>Speeches: Commencement exercises often feature speeches from various individuals like A keynote speaker, who is often a distinguished guest, alumni, or notable figure invited to inspire and motivate graduates and/or A valedictorian or student representative, who delivers a speech on behalf of the graduating class, reflecting on their experiences and future aspirations.</p>

<p>Presentation of Degrees/Diplomas: The main part of the ceremony involves the presentation of degrees or diplomas to the graduates. Each graduate's name is called, and they typically walk across the stage to receive their diploma or degree certificate.</p>

<p>Conferring of Degrees: The official conferring of degrees is often done by a school official who formally declares the graduates as having met all requirements for their degrees.</p>

<p>Awards and Honors: Some ceremonies include the presentation of special awards and honors to outstanding students or faculty.</p>

<p>Musical Performances: There might be musical performances by students, faculty, or invited guests, adding a celebratory atmosphere to the event.</p>

<p>Closing Remarks: The ceremony often concludes with closing remarks from a school official, summarizing the event and offering final words of encouragement.</p>

<p>Recessional: Similar to the processional, the ceremony ends with a recessional, where participants exit in a formal manner.</p>
